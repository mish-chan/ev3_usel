- Designing the "car" part of the robot (i.e. how to make it move forward and turn smoothly without wobbles)
- Built a differential as a possible plan
- Working on using the motor to steer the front wheels

- Finished assembly of frame, designed and built front rack-and-pinion steering.
- Attached differential and steering to frame, routed wiring. 
- Began testing of sensors in a real-world environment.
- The PixyCam has been trained to recognize the green and red blocks using PixyMon V2. The documents related to PixyCam object recognition training can be found here: https://docs.pixycam.com/wiki/doku.php?id=wiki:v2:teach_pixy_an_object_2.
- Using the PixyCam blocks in EV3 Home, a test program was written for the camera to print out "Red Block," "Green Block," or "No Block" based on trained signature recognition as mentioned above.
