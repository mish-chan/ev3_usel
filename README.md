# ev3_usel

Using the battle-tested EV3 Lego Mindstorm kits, we lay out a curriculum for introducing middle and high school students to the World Robotics Olympiad competition.
Included are build instructions (WIP), completed code which can be easily broken into lesson plans (WIP), and [assembly / programming methedology](https://github.com/mish-chan/ev3_usel/blob/ab6fb23bf6145a59b3a92bf3b1dd5e26fd6c3bf9/methodology/Build-Progress).
